## Dataset Overview

TLID dataset is captured using 16 thermal cameras and 8 LiDAR setups mounted at 3 different highly busy crossings of Ingolstadt city, namely Goethe straße, shiller straße and Friedrich-Ebert straße and at the CARISSMA outdoor test track. These sensors are part of the High-Definition Test track (HDT), a smart infrastructure built in Ingolstadt city for studying the interaction between traffic participants.

It is important to mention that out of the 7070 labelled images, 4662 of them have corresponding time-synchronized point clouds.
